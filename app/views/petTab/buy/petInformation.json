        "ailments": "Bloat, due to his size and deep chest,Hip dysplasia, Arthritis, Degenerative myelopathy, Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency",
        "care": "Originally bred to herd flocks all day, German Shepherds are built for action. This means they've got lots of energy that they need to burn off with daily exercise. If you leave them alone for long periods of time without exercise, expect trouble. Boredom and inactivity lead to behavior problems — chewing, digging, and barking. The German Shepherd desperately needs to exercise both their body (jogging, a romp at the dog park) and their mind (training exercises like agility or obedience competitions). Like many herding breeds, German Shepherds are barkers. Barking isn't necessarily a problem, but it can be if the dog is bored. Learning the \"Quiet\" command should be part of every German Shepherd's obedience training. German Shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. If they pick the wrong thing to gnaw on, they can damage their teeth, swallow something that makes them sick, or even choke. Save your dog, and your belongings, by giving them safe chew toys and bones so they can entertain themselves when you're not playing with them.",
        "description": "The German shepherd dog is a herding breed known for its courage, loyalty and guarding instincts. This breed makes an excellent guard dog, police dog, military dog, guide dog for the blind and search and rescue dog. For many families, the German shepherd is also a treasured family pet.",

        "exterior": "Some German Shepherds are longhaired. However, the \"ideal\" German Shepherd has a double coat of medium length. The outer coat is dense with straight hair that lies close to the body, and is sometimes wavy and wiry. 75-95 pounds and 1 foot, 10 inches to 2 feet, 2 inches tall at the shoulder.",
        "feeding": "A German Shepherd Dog diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your German Shepherd Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.",
        "fullDescription": "The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is one of America’s most popular dog breeds — for good reasons. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile. The breed also goes by the name Alsatian. Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to adopt! Don’t shop if this is the breed for you. GSDs excel at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and — last but not least — faithful companion. See below for all dog breed traits and facts about German Shepherds!",
        "grooming": "Sometimes jokingly called \"German shedders,\" the breed sheds year-round, and generally \"blows\" - sheds a lot of hair at once, like a snowstorm - twice a year. If you want a German Shepherd, be prepared for hair on your black pants, on your white couch, and pretty much all over the house. There's no magic solution to shedding, and we just have to accept it. However, brushing two to three times a week will help more of the hair come out in a brush, rather than on your furnishings. And a sturdy vacuum cleaner doesn't hurt either. Bathing the dog too often strips the coat of oils that keep it healthy, so start running the bathwater only if your dog really needs it. It shouldn't be that often; despite their notoriety as a shedder, the German Shepherd tends to be fairly clean and odorless. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odour that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. German Shepherds love to chew, and the habit helps keep their teeth clean. Give them sturdy, safe dental chew toys or bones, and they'll be fighting tartar buildup as they gnaw, especially on the back molars. Brushing their teeth with a soft toothbrush and doggy toothpaste also helps keep gums and teeth in good shape.",

        "personality": "The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. They're reserved dogs; they don't make friends immediately, but once they do, they're extremely loyal. With their family, they're easy-going and approachable, but when threatened, they can be strong and protective, making them excellent watchdogs. This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do—any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim. One thing they're not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship they need-as well as exercise and the chance to put their intelligence to work—they become bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who's under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing. Like every dog, the German Shepherd needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.",

Completing the picture is a slightly rounded skull, black nose, drop ears, dark, alert eyes, short, straight legs, and a graceful tail. He's a sweet, intelligent dog who is devoted to his people. And as one of the smallest of the toy breeds, he's well suited to apartment or condo living. Wherever he lives, the Maltese is responsive to his environment and makes an effective watchdog. Although they look delicate and aristocratic, Maltese can have a lot of energy. They learn quickly if rewarded for their efforts. Because they have a long history as companion dogs, Maltese require a lot of human attention and suffer from separation anxiety. If left alone for hours each day, they can bark and become destructive.",

The aim of crossbreeding is to minimise the genetic diseases that can be present in purebred dogs. First-cross cavoodles will have the maximum genetic benefits associated with a hybrid dog – in other words, a cavoodle with one parent purebred cavalier king charles spaniel and one parent purebred poodle will have less genetic diseases than second or third cross cavoodles.",
        "grooming": "Cavoodles usually do not shed and are often tolerated by allergic people. Their coats do take a great deal of care though, generally requiring professional grooming, as well as regular combing and brushing at home. The cavoodle should be taken to a groomer about every six weeks for a clip of your choice. The cavoodle’s ears need frequent cleaning or they may become infected and, daily teeth brushing is recommended or tartar will build up rapidly and lead to gingivitis.

They’re affectionate with almost everyone, so long as new people don’t mind some shedding and stray hairs on their clothes. The Samoyed's fondness for humans probably stems from his close association with the Samoyede (now know as the Nenetsky) people who bred and raised him thousands of years ago on the Taimyr Peninsula of Siberia. The dogs pulled sleds, herded reindeer, hunted game, and protected the Samoyede against predators. The dogs also lived with the people, played with the children (which he still enjoys), and helped keep them warm in the cold climate. To this day, the Samoyed's reputation as an intelligent, dignified, family dog is well deserved. He often chooses to dote on one special person in the household, but he is affectionate with everyone in the pack. Happiest when he is part of family life, this breed needs to be with people. In fact, leaving a Samoyed alone too much is the best way to make him miserable.",

Affectionately called Rotties or Rotts, the breed originated in Germany, where it was used to drive cattle and pull carts for farmers and butchers. That heritage is reflected in the Rottie's broad chest and heavily muscled body. When he moves, he displays strength and stamina, but when you look into his eyes you see warm, dark-brown pools reflecting a mellow, intelligent, alert, and fearless expression. A well-bred Rottweiler is calm and confident. He's typically aloof toward strangers, but never timid or fearful. Rottweilers exhibit a \"wait-and-see\" attitude when confronted with new people and situations. When these characteristics come together as they should, the Rottweiler is a natural guard dog with a mellow disposition who is successful not only in police, military, and customs work, but also as a family friend and protector. Rotties have a natural instinct to protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense. It's essential to channel their power and protectiveness by providing early socialization, firm, fair, consistent training and leadership, and a regular job to perform. When this doesn't happen, Rottweilers can become dangerous bullies rather than the companionable guardians they're meant to be.",
        "grooming": "Brush your Rottie weekly with a firm bristle brush to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. He'll shed twice a year, and you'll probably want to brush more frequently during that time to keep the loose hair under control. Bathe him as needed. If you bathe him outdoors, it should be warm enough that you're comfortable without wearing long sleeves or a coat. If you aren't, it's too cold to be giving your Rottie a bath out there.",

        "personality": "The ideal Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous, never shy. He has a self-assured aloofness and doesn't make friends with people immediately or indiscriminately. Instead, he takes a wait-and-see attitude with new people or situations. With his family, he's affectionate, often following them around the house. This is not a highly excitable dog. He has an inherent desire to protect his family and property, but should never be aggressive toward people without cause. The Rottweiler is smart and adaptable with a strong work ethic.",

        "care": "Athletic and surprisingly fast, Pembrokes were bred to be herding dogs and require plenty of exercise each day. That said, they make fine apartment dogs as long as they get the physical stimulation they need.",
        "description": "Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an active and intelligent dog breed. Easy to train and eager to learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can find them in four different coat colors and markings. ",

        "exterior": "Pembrokes are double-coated, with a thick undercoat and a longer topcoat. They shed continuously, with heavier shedding at least twice a year. You'll find them in red, sable, black, tri-colored, or fawn, usually with white markings.",
        "feeding": "Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.",
        "fullDescription": "Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan. They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds developed separately. Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke. Pembroke Welsh Corgis (also called Pembrokes, PWCs or Pems) are the smallest of the American Kennel Club's Herding Group, and are also recognized by the United Kennel Club. Their coats can be red, sable, fawn or tri-colored (red, black and tan), usually with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle and belly. They also may have a narrow blaze on their heads. Pembroke heads are shaped much like the head of a fox. Their eyes are oval-shaped and dark, and their ears are erect.",
        "grooming": "The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Pems have fluffy coats — long with excessive feathering on the ears, chest, legs and feet. Pembrokes are easy to groom, but shedding can be a problem if you don't keep up with the brushing, especially during the heavier seasonal shedding. When they are shedding the most, daily brushing is recommended. You only need to bathe them as needed, but many people find that regular bathing also helps control heavy shedding.",

They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. They are easy to train, but don't expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves.",

        "description": "The Bengal could never be called delicate. They’re athletes: agile and graceful with a strong, muscular body, as befits a cat who looks as if they belong in the jungle. Despite their wild appearance, Bengal cats are actually quite affectionate with their human families. That said, they also have high energy and a fun-loving, playful side. They want to stay active and need a home that can match their energy.",

        "exterior": "The Bengal could never be called delicate. He is an athlete: agile and graceful with a strong, muscular body, as befits a cat who looks as if he belongs in the jungle. His broad head is a modified wedge shape, longer than it is wide, with rounded contours. Atop it are medium-size to small ears that are relatively short, set toward the side of the head. Large oval eyes are almost round. Joining the head to the body is a long, muscular neck. Supporting the body are medium-length legs, slightly longer in the back than in the front, with large, round paws. A thick, medium-length tail  tapers at the end and is tipped in black. When a Bengal rolls over, you can see that another characteristic is a spotted belly. Enhancing the Bengal’s wild appearance is a short, thick pelt that feels luxuriously soft and silky. It comes in several colors and patterns, including brown tabby, seal mink tabby, black silver tabby, and seal silver lynx point. The coat can be spotted randomly or in horizontal patterns, or it can be marbled, with horizontal stripes arranged randomly on a lighter background. Some Bengals have a coat that is described as “glittered.” The fur shimmers in the light, as if it were tipped with gold dust.",
        "feeding": "Bengals are a large cat and requires approximately 80 Kcals of food per kg of bodyweight per day. Although this is a large cat it must not be obese and a careful watch must be kept on the diet.",
        "fullDescription": "With his distinctive spotted coat and large size, the Bengal looks like a wild cat on the prowl, but although one of his ancestors is the small, wild Asian leopard cat, he’s a domestic cat through and through. Bengals take their name from the Asian leopard cat’s scientific name, Felis bengalensis. They were created through crosses between an Asian leopard cat — which in the 1950s and into the 1960s could be purchased at pet stores — and domestic shorthairs. Jean Mill, a breeder in California, was the first to make such a cross, but not because she wanted to create a new breed. She had acquired a leopard cat and allowed her to keep company with a black tom cat so she wouldn’t be lonely. To her surprise, since she hadn’t thought the two species would mate, kittens resulted, and Mill kept a spotted female. Breeding her back to her father produced a litter of spotted and solid kittens.",
        "grooming": "Bengal cats moderately shed. The short close lying coat of the Bengal does not require much grooming although they do appreciate the attention that comes with it.",

        "exterior": "With his short, thick coat, round head and cheeks, big round eyes, and rounded body, the British Shorthair resembles nothing so much as a cuddly teddy bear. His body is compact but powerful with a broad chest, strong legs with rounded paws and a thick tail with a rounded tip. The coat comes in just about any color or pattern you could wish for, including lilac, chocolate, black, white, pointed, tabby and many more. The best known color is blue (gray) and the cats are sometimes referred to as British Blues. The shorthair does not reach full physical maturity until he is 3 to 5 years old.",
        "feeding": "The British Shorthair is a large cat and will require approximately 70 Kcals per kg bodyweight per day of food. However, many British Shorthairs are prone to obesity, particularly neuters, and some restriction on their diet may be necessary.",
        "fullDescription": "The British Shorthair is native to England. With the rise of cat shows during the Victorian era, cat fanciers began to breed the cats to a particular standard and keep pedigrees for them. At the earliest cat shows, British Shorthairs were the only pedigreed cats exhibited. All others were simply described by coat type or color. While some cats get a reputation for being high-strung and jumpy, the British Shorthair is anything but. If you’re looking for a best buddy who stays calm as a cucumber and won’t do much pestering, this might just be the feline for you. ",
        "grooming": "One of the reasons that the British Shorthair became so popular in the last century was because it needed no grooming. The coat is short and dense and the cat can easily look after it itself.",

        "breedName": "Persian cat",
        "ailments": "The Persian Longhair can suffer from runny eyes and breathing difficulties if they have particularly snub faces (often known as ultra type). They can also be prone to cystitis.",
        "care": "The most important thing to understand about caring for a Persian is the need for daily grooming. That long, beautiful coat doesn’t stay clean and tangle-free on its own. It must be gently but thoroughly combed and brushed every day, and regular bathing—at least once a month—is a good idea. Another factor to consider is the litter box issue. Litter may become lodged in a Persian’s paws or coat. If the cat and the litter box aren’t kept scrupulously clean, a Persian is more likely than most to just stop using the box. Excessive tearing can be a problem in this breed, so wipe the corners of the eyes clean daily to prevent under-eye stains from forming. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. It’s a good idea to keep a Persian as an indoor-only cat. She’s not a scrapper and would fare poorly against other cats, dogs, coyotes and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors. Nor is the Persian’s coat made for shedding dirt, leaves and stickers. Letting a Persian outdoors just means that much more time spent grooming the cat. Persians who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.",
        "description": "The dignified and docile Persian cat is known for being quiet and sweet. Although Persians tend to be relaxed and easygoing, they also command an air of royalty. They may not be quick to hiss or scratch, but that doesn’t mean they won’t become annoyed when bothered by loud children or pets. However, those who treat the Persian cat with the dignity and gentleness they deserve will be rewarded with an affectionate lap cat who enjoys a good petting, or even a brush through their hair. If you want a best friend who will return all your dedication and love in kind, the Persian may be the right feline for your family.",
        "descriptionImage": "https://cattime.com/assets/uploads/gallery/persian-cats-and-kittens/persian-cats-and-kittens-3.jpg",
        "exterior": "The Persian has a distinctive appearance: a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body—a type known as “cobby.” A Persian’s legs are short, thick and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat’s body. A long, thick, shiny coat with a fine texture completes the Persian’s look. It’s long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full “brush,” or tail. Persians can come in different “looks.” Some, known as Peke-face Persians, have an extremely flat face. Think twice about the breathing problems such a cat might have before deciding to get one. “Doll-face” Persians are said to have a more old-fashioned appearance, with a face that is not as flat as the show Persian or the Peke-face Persian. Persians of all stripes stand out for their infinite variety of coat colors and patterns. Imagine, if you will, seven solid color divisions—white, blue, black, red, cream, chocolate and lilac—plus silver and golden division colors of chinchilla and shaded silver or golden and blue chinchilla and blue shaded silver or golden; and then there are the shaded, smoke, tabby, calico, particolor and bicolor divisions. That’s not counting the various pointed patterns of the Himalayan. Eye color is related to coat color. For instance, white Persians have deep blue or brilliant copper eyes; other solid-colored Persians have brilliant copper eyes; silver and golden Persians have green or blue-green eyes; and so on.",

        "fullDescription": "The Persian is an old breed. To those who love this elegant cat, it will come as no surprise that the longhaired beauty originated in the cradle of civilization: Mesopotamia, which was later known as Persia and is now modern-day Iran. The breed’s long hair was probably the result of a natural mutation, and its striking appearance attracted the attention of 17th-century Italian nobleman and world traveler Pietro Della Valle, who is credited with bringing the first longhaired cats to Europe in 1626. At that time, the cats had shiny, silky gray fur, but thanks to selective breeding Persians are now found in a kaleidoscope of colors, including bi-color (a color plus white). Until the late 19th century, when breeding and showing cats became popular, longhaired cats from Persia, Turkey, Afghanistan and other exotic locales were known simply as “Asiatic” cats and were often bred together. At the Crystal Palace cat show in 1871, Persian-type cats were among the breeds exhibited. They were popular pets of the time and had a special cachet because of Queen Victoria’s fondness for the breed. Even in the Victoria era, association with a “celebrity” ensured an animal’s desirability. Through selective breeding, cat fanciers began to mold the Persian to its present-day appearance. They bred cats to have a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, small, rounded ears, big eyes, and a sturdy body. Their fur was longer than that of the Angora cat, and they had shorter legs. Soon, the Persians surpassed the Angoras in popularity. In the United States, where they were first imported in the late 19th century, they also became favorites, edging out the longhaired Maine Coon cat, which had once held pride of place as an American sweetheart. In the little more than a century since, the Persian has become the most beloved cat breed in the world, prized for its beautiful appearance and sweet personality.",

Persians are affectionate but discriminating. They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust. Loud environments aren’t a Persian’s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day. With large, expressive eyes and a voice that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Persians let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold. This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture. When you are at work or are busy around the house, the Persian is content to adorn a chair, sofa or bed until you are free to admire her and give her the attention she willingly receives but never demands.",

        "fullDescription": "The sophisticated Siamese looks dressed for an elegant masquerade ball in pale evening wear with chic black accessories and tanzanite-blue eyes. Cats with light-colored coats set off with black mask, ears, paws and tail have been known in Thailand (formerly Siam) for centuries. Ancient manuscripts depict the cats, but they were not seen in the West until the late nineteenth century, when they were exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in London. Not everyone appreciated their unusual appearance, but they quickly became fashionable pets. By the turn of the century, if not earlier, they were popular in the United States as well. President Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) and his wife Lucy were the recipients of a Siamese cat shipped to them in 1878 by David B. Sickels, a U. S. diplomat stationed at the consulate in Thailand. A letter from Sickels detailing the gift is on file at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio. At first, only the cats with seal points—a dark brownish-black—were shown, but blue, chocolate and lilac-point Siamese were soon developed and accepted in the show ring. Today Siamese come in many different point colors and patterns, including tabby points and smoke points. The Siamese itself is a natural breed, meaning its original pointed pattern was the result of a genetic mutation. The breed has contributed to the creation of many other breeds, including the Balinese, Oriental, the Himalayan division of the Persian, the Tonkinese and the Havana Brown. The Siamese is recognized by all cat associations. The International Cat Association also recognizes the Thai, described as the original form of the native pointed cat of Thailand. In Thailand the cats are called Wichienmaat. Some people refer to it as an old-style Siamese. It shares the pointed coat and domineering personality of the Siamese but has a more moderate body type.",

We are Siamese if you don’t please.” Those lines, sung by two haughty Siamese cats in Disney’s Lady and the Tramp, express the Siamese personality perfectly. Perhaps the most important thing to know about these cats is they are talkative and opinionated. They will tell you exactly what they think, in a loud, raspy voice, and they expect you to pay attention and act on their advice. Siamese cats are extremely fond of their people. They like to be “helpful” and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Siamese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. Do not get a Siamese if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, the Siamese can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Siamese do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company. The Siamese is highly intelligent, agile, athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty. Choose a Siamese cat if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.",

        "ailments": "The Ragdoll is a predominantly healthy breed. As with all cats it is a good idea to have an annual health check from the age of 8.",
        "care": "A Ragdoll’s moderately long fur has little undercoat, which means it is less likely to mat and shed, but that doesn’t mean the cats need no grooming. Comb it twice a week with a stainless steel comb to remove dead hair that can cause tangles. Be sure to comb the fur on the legs thoroughly, especially where the leg meets the body, where mats are most likely to occur. A rubber curry brush will smooth the fur after you comb it and remove any remaining loose hairs. If you are gentle and don’t pull their hair, Ragdolls will love the attention they receive from you during grooming time. Note that seasonal changes as well as hormonal fluctuations in unaltered cats can affect the length of the coat. The coat will be at its peak in winter. Ragdolls that have been spayed or neutered will usually have a lush coat year-round because they lack the hormonal fluctuations that occur in unaltered cats. Check the tail for bits of poop stuck to the fur and clean it off with a baby wipe. Bathe a Ragdoll as needed, which can range from every few weeks to every few months. If his coat feels greasy or his fur looks stringy, he needs a bath. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don’t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear. Keep the Ragdoll’s litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will help to keep the coat clean as well. Speaking of litter boxes, a large cat like the Ragdoll needs a box that is super-sized to ensure that he has plenty of room to turn around and squat. Ragdolls usually go through several growth spurts as they mature. These can continue off and on until the cat is four years old. Don’t be deceived by the pad of fat on the belly, which is a trait of the breed. Until you are sure they have reached their mature size, make sure they always have plenty of food available to fuel their growth. It’s a good idea to keep the gentle Ragdoll as an indoor-only cat to protect him from attacks by dogs or coyotes, diseases spread by other cats, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Ragdolls who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.",

        "exterior": "Ragdolls stand out for their large size, semi-long coat in a pointed pattern, and sparkling blue eyes. They are among the largest of the domesticated cats, with some males weighing in at 20 pounds or more. A Ragdoll has a light-colored body with a darker face, legs, tail and ears. He comes in three patterns: mitted and bicolor, both of which have white, and colorpoint, which has no white. Ragdolls don’t reach their full size and coat development until they are three to four years old. The Cat Fanciers Association breed standard says the Ragdoll should have a large, broad head in a modified wedge shape. All sides of the head should be of equal length and the muzzle should be gently rounded. The eyes are described as vivid blue ovals. Medium-size ears have rounded tips and tilt forward. Supporting the head is a heavy, strong neck, which segues into a large and long body that is broad, solid and heavy-boned. The heavy-boned legs are moderately long, with the hind legs longer than the front legs. Large round paws are tufted with fur, and the long tail looks like a waving plume. The Ragdoll has a silky coat that is moderately long. It’s short on the face, blossoms into a ruff around the neck, shortens again on the shoulder blades, then lengthens toward the tail, which is fully feathered with fur. Depending on the association, the coat comes in four patterns--bi-color, van, mitted and colorpoint—up to six colors: seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream, and points that may be solid, lynx, tortie, or torbie (tortie and lynx). That adds up to many different possibilities when it comes to color and pattern. Mitted Ragdolls are just what they sound like: they have four white feet, plus a white chin and belly, and sometimes a white spot on the face that may look like a blaze, star or hourglass. Bi-colors have even more white than mitteds, including on the chest and belly and sometimes on the back. On the face they may have a white inverted V-shape. Vans have the most white on the body, and Colorpoints have no white. Ragdolls sold as pets may have slight cosmetic imperfections that make them unsuitable for the show ring. These might include ears set higher on the head than preferred, a nose that doesn’t turn up at the tip, eyes that aren’t Crater Lake-blue, or maybe mitts that don’t go up high enough on the hind legs. As long as they have the sweet, loving Ragdoll temperament, none of that really matters for a cat who will be a beloved companion instead of a show-ring star.",

        "fullDescription": "In the family of cat breeds, Ragdolls are among the younger siblings. The cats were first developed by breeder Ann Baker in Riverside, California, in the 1960s. Baker’s foundation stock consisted of Josephine, a domestic longhair whose white coat concealed the genes for either a seal mitted or black tuxedo pattern, and various other longhaired cats of unknown ancestry that she owned or found in her neighborhood. Baker selected for cats with gentle, placid personalities, large size, and beautiful long coats characterized by a Himalayan pattern, the name for the “points” seen on Siamese-type cats. The result was a cat she called the Ragdoll, for its propensity to flop happily into the arms of anyone who picked it up. Later, Persians, Birmans and Burmese may also have contributed to the Ragdoll’s development. Baker made many unusual claims about the cats’ development, including alien influence, CIA experiments, and infusions of human genes, but that is all they are: claims, with no basis in fact. Other people had begun breeding Ragdolls as well. They broke away from Baker and formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International, with the goal of standardizing the breed and achieving recognition by cat registries. The Cat Fanciers Association began registering the cats in 1993 and gave them full recognition in 2000. Most registries now recognize the breed, including the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breeds.",
        "grooming": "The Ragdoll does require regular grooming to keep its striking coat in good condition. If the grooming process is started as a kitten they soon become used to it and enjoy the attention it brings.

They often learn to come when called or to retrieve toys that are thrown for them. The word most often used to describe them is docile, but that doesn’t mean they are inactive. They like to play with toys and enter into any family activities. With positive reinforcement in the form of praise and food rewards when they do something you like, Ragdolls learn quickly and can pick up tricks as well as good behaviors such as using a scratching post. In a small, sweet voice, they remind you of mealtime or ask for petting but are not excessively vocal. Ragdolls have nice manners and are easy to live with.

Kittens are born with straight ears, which may or may not fold when they are about three weeks old. Wide open eyes gaze out at the world with a sweet expression. The medium-size body is also rounded, completed by a medium to long tail that sometimes ends in a rounded tip. A shorthaired Fold has a dense, plush coat with a soft texture. The longhaired variety has medium-long to long fur with britches (longer fur on the upper thighs), toe tufts, a plumed tail, and tufts of fur on the ears. They may also have a ruff around the neck.

        "fullDescription": "Often, the creation of a new cat breed hinges on a natural genetic mutation that occurs unexpectedly in an otherwise ordinary cat. Such was the case with the Scottish Fold. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to Susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in Scotland's Tayside region. Susie might have lived her life in obscurity had she not been noticed in 1961 by a shepherd named William Ross who had an interest in cats. When Susie had kittens with a local tom, Ross acquired one of them, a female he named Snooks. In the natural way of things, Snooks had kittens, and one, a male was bred to a British Shorthair. Thus began the development of what were first known as 'lop-eared cats,' later as Scottish Folds, a nod to their country of origin and their defining characteristic. Other breeders became involved, and it was determined that the gene mutation for the fold was dominant, meaning that if one parent passed on a gene for straight ears and the other a gene for folded ears, the resulting kitten would have folded ears. A gene for long hair was another gift Susie passed on to her descendants. The longhaired variety is known as a Highland Fold in some associations. Scottish Folds were first imported into the United States in 1971. By the mid-1970s, they had been recognized by most cat associations in North America. They can be outcrossed to American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs. Ironically, they are not recognized as a breed in their country of origin over concerns that the folded ear might lead to ear infections or deafness and because of a related cartilage problem.",

And although you might assume that their ears are less mobile than those of other cats, such is not the case.

To hug him is to melt into the warmth of his suedelike coat. A Sphynx does not have a higher body temperature than other cats, but it seems like it because there is no fur to serve as insulation.  A broad chest and a well-rounded abdomen give him the appearance of having eaten just a little too much at dinnertime, but he should not be fat. Supporting the body are firm, muscular legs set on oval paws with long, slender toes. Thick paw pads make the Sphynx look as if he is walking on “air cushions.” A long, slender, flexible tail is described as whiplike. A Sphynx with a little tuft of fur on the end of the tail is said to have a lion tail. Sphynx kittens are heavily wrinkled, but as they grow the wrinkles smooth out, although some remain throughout the cat’s life. A Sphynx should not be so wrinkled that eyesight or other functions are compromised. The head of the Sphynx is a modified wedge shape, slightly longer than it is wide, with prominent cheekbones, large ears and large, lemon-shaped eyes. Whiskers and eyebrows are sparse to nonexistent. The Sphynx comes in all colors and patterns, including white, black, red, chocolate, lavender, various tabby patterns, tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor, and pointed and mink patterns. The color is seen in the pigment of the skin as well as in whatever hair the cat has and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish.",
        "feeding": "The Sphynx will require approximately 80 Kcals of food per kg of bodyweight per day. They are not prone to obesity and tend to limit their dietary requirements themselves.",
        "fullDescription": "The hairless Sphynx is an example of the cat breeds that come about accidentally. A genetic mutation brought about the birth of a hairless kitten to Elizabeth, a black and white domestic cat in Toronto, Canada. Elizabeth’s owner recognized that Prune, as the kitten was called, was unique and set about trying to reproduce him. He, along with other hairless kittens that were born in the mid- to late 1970s, was bred to furred cats, including the Devon Rex. The gene for hairlessness is recessive, so while some of the offspring were hairless, others had fur. Originally known as Canadian Hairless Cats, according to The International Cat Association, breeders eventually settled on the moniker Sphynx for the unusual breed, a reference to the gigantic limestone sculpture in the Egyptian desert, worn smooth over the millennia through erosion by wind, sand and water. The Sphynx is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association, as well as other cat registries. Perhaps the world’s most famous Sphynx is Mr. Bigglesworth, played by Ted NudeGent, in the Austin Powers comedies.",
        "grooming": "As they have no real hair grooming is not a problem with the Spyhnx. However, because they sweat it is necessary to sponge them down regularly to remove the oily residues, otherwise sores can appear in the skin folds.",

Most veterinarians prefer to wait until they are 6 months old as the older they are, the less risk there is on the operating table. Bucks can be neutered as young as 3 1/2 months of age. The breed is not at-risk for any particular health problems, but bunnies (both domestic and commercial) are always susceptible to a number of health issues. This includes snuffles, hairballs, uterine tumors, calicivirus, myxomatosis, and overgrown teeth. The latter is completely preventable. Usually, rabbits who have a high-fiber diet of hay won’t have this issue, as their teeth wear down from chewing on this harsh food. If you find your rabbit’s teeth seem to be growing a little faster than they are wearing down, providing straw or wicker mats, rabbit-safe blocks of wood, or straw baskets are a great way for them to have fun and wear their teeth down.",
        "care": "Most rabbits are immaculately clean, and since washing them is an absolute no-no, groom your bunny with a brush a few times a month to keep their fur in tip-top shape. When it comes to buying an enclosure for your rabbit, you have quite a few options. You can opt to have an indoor rabbit cage or purchase a dog crate and add some nifty bunny-friendly modifications, which is great for apartment dwellers. If you have a little bit more room outdoors or even have your own fenced backyard, you can purchase or build your own rabbit hutch or even a rabbit shed! But whenever you have an outdoor enclosure for your rabbit, always be aware of outdoor temperatures, how much sun your rabbit is exposed to and if there are any local predators you should be wary of (racoons, birds, coyotes, etc). Indoor rabbits will no doubt have a deep connection with their owner, especially if they take the time to play with their little hoppers. Rabbits benefit from having lots of both indoor and outdoor playtime to stretch their legs and have a great time with their human friends. Many rabbits have different places they like to be petted, however most enjoy being stroked on their cheeks and forehead. If your rabbit likes this, they will more than likely put their head on the ground and close their eyes blissfully! ",

        "fullDescription": "The American Rabbit was developed in 1917 by Lewis H. Salisbury of Pasadena, California. While he never said which breeds he used to develop the American rabbit, it is generally believes that he crossed a few blue European rabbits such as the Vienna, Blue Imperial, Flemish Giant and Beveren. Back in 1910, the American rabbit used to be called the “German Blue” and a second variety of this rabbit, the white, was added in 1925. The “German Blue” changed into “American” shortly after World War I. After WWII, interest in this rabbit declined as commercial rabbit breeders sought to find a faster-growing rabbit, and those who wanted rabbits for show purposes wanted a smaller, cuter rabbit or one with interesting markings. Unfortunately, this breed became the rarest breed in the United States by the early 2000s with a mere 200 known to exist. Thankfully, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy became aware of this problem and undertook measures to ensure the breed’s survival.",
        "grooming": "To keep their coat dirt-free, make sure to groom your rabbit as necessary and under no circumstances should you give them a bath, as this stresses your rabbit out and can cause them to go into cardiac arrest. Bathing them also destroys many of the natural qualities for their fur. Don’t worry; rabbits are relatively clean creatures and can take care of their own bathing requirements. When your American rabbit molts, be aware of how often you brush them. If they are only shedding a little bit, keep your brushing to a minimum. Be sure to increase the amount of brushings depending on how much they shed. Remember that like dogs, rabbits also have heavier shedding periods during particular times of the year.",

While an adult will understand it was simply instinct, a child won’t be so quick to forgive. It’s all in the way and the environment in which they were raised.

Two problems that are most common in outdoor rabbits are ear mites and flystrike. Flystrike is common to rabbits that have soiled fur during the summer. Flies lay their eggs in soiled fur and when the eggs hatch, their primary food source is the rabbit. It is extremely painful and symptoms include lack of appetite, fewer droppings in your bunny’s cage and sudden jumping/thrashing in pain. If you suspect your rabbit may have flystrike, take them to your veterinarian for treatment. A pea-sized amount of deworming paste is recommended every fall and spring to keep your rabbit healthy. Finally, if your rabbit’s diet does not consist of 70 percent hay, the rabbit’s incisors begin to grow into their faces/jaws. This is a painful condition and can only be corrected by a veterinarian, who can shave down their teeth. A simple change in their diet should keep their teeth naturally worn down.",

The bottom of the cages need to be lined in bedding, spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every 5-7 days. While Belgian Hares can do fine in temperatures above the freezing mark (so long as sufficient protection and bedding is given to keep them warm), there needs to be sufficient ventilation during the summer months.

        "feeding": "When it comes to their diet, this rabbit breed needs access to clean, fresh water and high-quality hay.  Hay should be 70 percent of their diet while the rest consists of a  healthy balance of pellets and rabbit-safe vegetables, fruits and leafy greens. There are some foods that should be avoided (iceberg lettuce, for example, does not have enough nutritional value), while others are fine in moderation (apples and carrots are a wonderful treat).",
        "fullDescription": "The Belgian Hare breed’s lengthy history originates in 18th century Belgium where they were developed using selective breeding tactics from domestic and wild European rabbits with the intention of making a hearty meat. They were imported as early as 1856 into England,  and dubbed the “Belgian Hare”, but it wasn’t until 1873 that a man by the name of Winter “William” Lumb and Benjamin Greaves developed into the breed that exists today. The first Belgian Hare was shown in America in 1877 where its popularity rapidly grew. The “National Belgian Hare Club” was formed in 1897, and the National Pet Stock Association added this breed under its “all-breed” club. After many name changes, the National Pet Stock Association eventually became known as the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). In 1972, a group of Belgian Hare breeders came together and applied for a specialty club charter. Soon after, the Belgian Hare was officially accepted into the ARBA.",

While this breed can theoretically live indoors, indoor rabbits tend to be pets and this rabbit breed isn’t the best pet due to its nervousness. Sudden noises or unfamiliar sounds cause them jump high into the air and go into a running frenzy inside of their cage, where they could accidentally hurt themselves. While they do have a sweet nature and are known to enjoy petting (so long as they are used to the person’s presence and are not suddenly spooked), Belgian Hares are not the breed for everyone and are used mostly for show purposes. While they can be picked up, a lot of care needs to be taken to ensure that if they do get spooked, they don’t fall onto the floor.

Overgrown teeth is by far one of the most common problems. This can be prevented with a well-balanced diet consisting mostly of hay. If your rabbit doesn’t seem to be eating, is less energetic and/or has less droppings than usual, their teeth may be growing into their face and/or jaw. To correct overgrown teeth, take your rabbit to your veterinarian where they can shave down the teeth and prescribe antibiotics for any infection. Those caring for a rabbit should also check their ears periodically (bi-weekly) for any sign of ear mites, as it is also rather common, especially in outdoor rabbits. Flystrike is also another rabbit issue that occurs when flies lay their eggs in a rabbit’s soiled coat (usually on their bottom). When these eggs hatch, their sole source of protein is your rabbit. Lack of appetite, lethargy and/or sudden yelps of agony can be signs of flystrike. Take your rabbit to a veterinarian if you believe it has flystrike, as it could be deadly.",

There are many different kinds of hay available to feed your rabbit, but most owners opt to purchase timothy hay as it has a high percentage of crude protein, calcium and fiber, and is more readily available in stores. Others kinds of acceptable hay to feed your rabbit includes orchard grass, oat hay, meadow hay, or alfalfa.

She crossed a Papillon with a White Vienna, as well as a White Flemish Giant, and worked on this breed for 20 years. After crossing over 500 breeds, it wasn’t until 1920 that she showed the perfected breed to the Exposition international d’Aviculture in Paris. In October of 1922, the French officially recognized the breed and it was soon exported to the United States, however they did not last long and soon the Blanc de Hotot no longer existed in the US. The Blanc de Hotot was imported to Switzerland, but because of World War II, the rabbit breed nearly vanished in Europe. In 1978,  Bob Whitman of Texas imported eight Blanc de Hotots from France and showed them. This rabbit breed was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeder’s Association (ARBA) on March 5, 1979 but is still considered to be a globally endangered breed.",

Their sweet dispositions make Blanc de Hotots great for families looking to have their first pet as well as for singles, couples or seniors looking for companionship. While they are not known to be overly active, indoor rabbits will enjoy time outside so they can hop about the grass and explore the world around them. Some owners go outside with their rabbits on a leash, as most small dog harnesses fit them perfectly. When it comes to training, rabbits are known to be harder to train that other animals such as cats, dogs or birds. Having said that, it is not completely impossible to potty train, but it is going to be a challenge. Pet owners need to be armed with plenty of patience, time and treats in order to reward them for good behaviors.

Having said that, rabbits are susceptible to a few problems which differ from cats or dogs. Should you keep your rabbit mostly outdoors, for example, flystrike can happen, especially in hotter months. This occurs when flies lay their eggs in soiled parts of your rabbit’s fur (mostly near their bottoms) and once the eggs hatch, their main source of food is your rabbit while it still lives. This causes excruciating pain for your rabbit and can even be lethal – be sure to take your rabbit to your local vet to get them treated should you suspect this is happening. Also check your rabbit’s mouth every two weeks or so for overgrown teeth, as rabbit’s teeth never stop growing. Should their diet be low in hay, teeth can continue to grow into their faces and jaws, which can also be very painful.

This particular breed does well either in indoor or outdoor enclosures, as their coat is dense enough to handle cold temperatures (even with snow), so long as their outdoor enclosures are protected from the elements (sun, rain, snow). Outdoor enclosures should also be covered on three sides to protect rabbits from cold drafts in the winter, as well as provide ventilation and shade at the same time during the hotter months. Indoor enclosures should be made of wire, be large enough for them to stretch out in and have a plastic bottom.

The buck was bred with several of West’s New Zealand rabbits to increase their size, and so the Californian Rabbit was born. West gave a few of his stock to two trusted Southern California breeders and together, they perfected the breed. The Californian rabbit was first shown as a breed in 1928, its first appearance at an American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) convention in 1932 and became a recognized breed in 1939. Today, Californian rabbits are only surpassed in popularity by the New Zealand whites.",

While they may seem shy and sometimes even quiet, with proper socialization (which means lots of time outside of their enclosure, interacting with their human families), their personalities will bloom and you will soon find out that your Californian loves to play and be active but also loves to sit back and cuddle when the time is right.  This makes them great first-time pets for couples, singles, seniors or families with children of any age, so long as they are careful when holding or petting the rabbit. Always make younger children sit on the ground when they are petting rabbit (even ones as large as this one), as if they happen to fall or flip over, they won’t get as hurt since they are already near the ground. Like most rabbits, your Californian should be given a couple of toys to make sure they aren’t bored, as boredom can lead to the destruction of your personal property such as shoes, your room’s baseboard and basically anything else that they can sink their teeth into (much like puppies).  Toys can include a few balls, a paper towel roll or anything that is bunny-safe purchased from your local pet store. Unlike other pets such as dogs and cats, rabbits are a little bit tricker to litter train. With lots of time, patience and rewards, rabbits can be potty trained but it takes much longer than other pets. Instead of using just one litter box, try to spread a couple around the house so they won’t be tempted to do it in a corner because they cannot hold it in. When rabbit parents find that their bunny tends to do their business where they are not supposed to (such as their favorite corner in the living room), they put a litter box in that particular area and sometimes, that is enough to make the rabbit understand that this is where they need to do the deed.",

        "ailments": "Unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food, like hay. If your rabbit’s teeth are not being worn down, their teeth may start growing into their jaw and face, causing severe pain. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite, sluggish activity or drooling. Be sure to check your rabbit’s mouth weekly for signs of overgrown teeth and bring it to the vet if you suspect it has an infection caused by overgrown teeth. Vets can treat both the infection with antibiotics as well as shave down their teeth to a manageable length. Ears should also regularly be checked for ear mites, as this is a common condition in rabbits, especially those who are mostly outdoors. In order to protect them from worms, be sure to also give your rabbit a pea-sized amount of de-worming paste every spring and fall. Rabbits can be spayed and neutered and if you find your rabbit to be particularly aggressive, this can help calm them down. Does (female rabbits) can be spayed between 4-6 months of age (depending on how early your local vet can safely do the procedure) and bucks (male rabbits) can be neutered when they are just 3 1/2 months old.",
        "care": "Due to this rabbit’s size, they need a rather large enclosure to keep them comfortable while their human family is not in the home. This means having a cage that is at least 3 ft x 3 ft x 4 ft., and make sure that you rabbit can easily stretch out at the bottom of their cage. Enclosures should be made of wire and have a solid bottom (such as plastic or metal), as sores are easily made when rabbits lay on a wire-bottom cage for too long so for their safety and comfort, make sure to purchase a wire cage with a solid bottom. The bottom should also be lined with hay (horse hay is acceptable) and should be spot-cleaned for faeces every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. These rabbits do well either indoors or outdoors, but be sure that outdoor enclosures are covered from the elements (sun and rain), but also provide enough draft to keep them cool during warmer temperatures. Should the temperatures raise or drop too much, be sure to bring them indoors. These rabbits are mostly used for show rather than for meat purposes, but they can also make wonderful pets as long as they are given plenty of human affection and lots of outdoor playtime. Indoor rabbits need to have lots of time out of their enclosures in a bunny-safe room, which means everything and anything that could harm your rabbit is out of sight (electrical cords, for example).",

        "exterior": "This particular breed of rabbit has soft short- to medium-length fur which is soft and easy to maintain. The Checkered Giant is one of the few ARBA recognized breeds that has distinctive markings. The only color that the ARBA accepts is white with either blue or black markings resembling a butterfly across the nose. They also have two black or blue spots on either side of the body with a black or blue stripe running along from the base of their ears to their tail over the spine.",
        "feeding": "A Checkered Giant’s diet is not unlike any other pet rabbit in that it should consist of 70 percent good-quality hay. The rest of their diet should be a healthy mix of pellets, vegetables and fruits, but they should be given these sparingly. Fresh water and hay should be readily available to your rabbit at all times. If you’re unsure, the easiest thing is not to feed it to them. Some surprising foods that are actually dangerous to rabbits include onions, leeks, chives, and mustard greens. Contrary to popular belief, you should not feed your rabbit most types of lettuces, as they contain lactucarium, which will give your rabbit diarrhoea. There are plenty of other leafy greens and vegetables that you can feed your rabbit such as parsnips, watercress, Brussel sprouts and fennel.",
        "fullDescription": "The origin of the Checkered Giant breed is disputed, but it’s believed that this rabbit first made an appearance in 1800 either in France or Germany when Flemish Giants, French Lops and spotted rabbits were bred together to create a breed called “Land Kaninchen.” This breed was about 10-12 lbs and did not have the markings we know today’s Checkered Giant to have. They continued to breed them with Flemish Giants throughout Germany to increase their size, eventually making the “Lorraine rabbit”, sometimes called the “Great German Spotted rabbit.” In 1904, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Otto Reinhardt of Reinfalz, Germany, bred the Great German Spotted rabbit to a black Flemish Giant, which produced the Checkered Giant we know today. They arrived a mere six years later onto American soil and shortly after, the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) accepted the Checkered Giant as a recognized breed.",
        "grooming": "Most rabbits will clean themselves (as they are rather clean animals), however they are known to shed more in particular times of the year. If you keep your rabbit as an indoor pet, you’ll want to groom them once every week or every other week during shedding season in order to have the least amount of fur possible flying inside your home.",

        "personality": "This breed of rabbit isn’t as affectionate as other breeds, but that’s not to say they aren’t a gentle breed. They enjoy human interaction even when they are used for breeding/show purposes. The Checkered Giant would make a good pet for those looking for a sweet companion, but isn’t as cuddly or needy as other rabbit breeds. This breed does well with singles, couples or seniors who have a large enough home and backyard to keep it happy and healthy. They also do well with families with older children, as young children may not be able to hold them properly (as they are on the larger side of rabbits), and also may drop them more easily than medium-sized rabbits. Rabbits are arguably harder to potty train than other animals such as cats or dogs. Rabbits usually have a “potty corner” in their enclosure where they usually like to do the deed so if you place a litter box in that particular corner, they will generally make the connection and slowly understand that is where they are supposed to do their business. Some owners have found success by placing many litter boxes around their homes. Always approach potty training with lots of patience, time and treats to reward your rabbit when they have successfully completed a task (apple slices are great rabbit treats). In order to keep most of your possessions as bite-free as possible, ensure your rabbit has a few toys it can gnaw at. This can mean something as simple as a few toilet paper rolls to as lavish as a mentally stimulating rabbit-safe toy from your local pet store.",

Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite slugging activity or drooling around the mouth. Be sure to check your rabbit’s mouth often for signs of overgrown teeth and bring them to the vet if you suspect they have an infection, as it can be treated with antibiotics and veterinarians can also fix their overgrown teeth problem. Female rabbits (called does) can be spayed when they are as young as four months old, however vets tend to wait until they are six months old. Male rabbits (called bucks) are eligible to be neutered as young as three and a half months old. All rabbits should also be given worm prevention treatment and checked for ticks and fleas regularly.",
        "care": "Dutch rabbits are one of the oldest domestic breeds around, so you can be sure that they love to be outside their enclosure whenever possible. They will happily run and jump high into the air when they are out of their hut, especially if they are outside with some soft grass beneath their fuzzy little feet. Their enclosure could be indoors or out, weather and temperature-permitting. Rabbits do not do well in extreme heat and most do not do well in the cold (including the Dutch rabbit), so always be aware of outdoor conditions before letting your rabbit spend time outside. Their enclosure needs to be clean and dung-free. If there is hay bedding, always be sure to clean it at least once every other day. There is an age-old question when it comes to the domesticated rabbited: wire enclosure vs. bedding. Rabbits prefer bedding because it is easier on their feet and more comfortable while humans prefer to have wire-bottomed enclosures because it is easier to clean, however it is harder on the rabbit’s feet. With a wire-bottomed enclosure, their excrement simply falls through the wire and onto a removable bottom that owners can easily change while with bedding, you’ll have to go into the enclosure and clean it out, which is more time-consuming. In the end, the decision is that of the owner’s but if you want a happier rabbit, make or purchase an enclosure that has a hay bottom. It may be slightly more time-consuming to clean out their waste, but the result will be a rabbit that is comfortable with their enclosure and is less strenuous on their poor legs. These should be cleaned out thoroughly once a week, while droppings should be removed daily.",

Despite having so many types, however, their markings are almost all the same. They all have dark colored ears and rumps, a band of white from the top of their shoulders to their belly, white legs and a wedge of white fur running up the front of the face which is called the ‘Blaze’. There is the Black Dutch rabbit, which has pure white and slate black fur with dark brown eyes; the Blue Dutch whose eyes are a blue-grey and fur color is a medium-dark blue and glossy; and the Chinchilla Dutch who has either dark brown or blue-grey and their fur is a speckled grey mixed with white. There are four more Dutch rabbits that are also recognized in shows including the Chocolate Dutch (either dark-brown or ruby eyes and chocolate brown fur); the Gray Dutch that has mixed-colored fur (slate blue, medium tan, then charcoal brown and chocolate) and dark brown eyes; the Steel Dutch rabbit (dark brown eyes and a mostly black body with off-white or cream coloration on some of the hair tips); and finally, the Tortoise Dutch rabbit (bright orange/cream colored coat and dark brown eyes).",
        "feeding": "Like most rabbits, they will live a long, healthy life so long as they are fed a diet of 70 percent hay and the rest being a mix of pellets, fruits and vegetables. However, some fruits and vegetables can pose a danger to their health. Unless you’ve researched the fruit/vegetable and are sure it is safe to feed it to them, the rule of thumb is simply not to feed them if you are unsure. Some food that can be dangerous to your rabbit include seeds from fruits such as apples and pears – they contain tiny particles of cyanide and despite being harmless to humans, they can hurt your rabbit. Bark and cherry tree twigs should be avoided, as well rhubarb (it contains oxalates which prevents absorption of calcium) and mushrooms (this hurts them in the long run, as it has been shown to cause cancer in mice).",
        "fullDescription": "The Dutch rabbit is one of the oldest domestic rabbit breeds. It is a descendant of the Petite Brabançon from the Brabant region in Flanders which was bred in large numbers for the meat industry in the late 19th century. The Dutch rabbit is said to have originated sometime around 1850 in Holland, where it is called the Hollander Rabbit. In 1864, it found its way to England where it grew in popularity and has since then been exported to many places around the world.",
        "grooming": "Like most rabbit breeds, the Dutch rabbit will also go through a seasonal molt (much like a dog when it sheds in the spring). During that time, you will have to groom them a little more often than usual. When they go through molts, you can expect to have your clothes full of their fur when you pick them up and give them some loving, which is why daily brushing during molts is a must.

They are wonderful first-time pets, as they are relatively low maintenance so long as you provide them with essential items to keep them safe, healthy and happy. Because they are such sociable animals, they are also good pets for couples and seniors, so long as retirees are able to physically to tend to the rabbit’s needs which includes feeding them, cleaning their enclosure and etc. Rabbits take on a completely different approach when it comes to training. Activities that humans would deem unacceptable such as urinating in the corner or scratching up your carpet are completely natural to them and you must understand this before trying to train any kind of rabbit. They are also not children in that you should not punish them if they do something unpleasant, as this will get you nowhere with training. Instead, you should only reward them with a treat when they complete something successfully (such as urinating in the proper area). Never yell or shout at your rabbit when you become frustrated that are not as obedient as you would like them to be, as rabbits will consider you the enemy and may become aggressive or dislike you and absolutely refuse to participate in any further training.

This means clipping their toenails so they don’t accidentally step on their ears and hurt them. Also, never leave a bowl of water outside for your rabbit when the temperature is hovering just over or is under the freezing mark. If the Lop’s ears touch the water, there is a risk of the tips of the ears freezing and consequently tearing. Moreover, this breed of rabbit does better in the heat than in the cold because of their large ears, so always be aware of the weather conditions outside and bring your rabbit indoors should it be to cold for them to handle. The inside of their ears should also be regularly checked for excess buildup of wax and must be cleaned periodically. Like most other rabbits, they should also have their mouths checked for overgrown teeth, as they do not stop growing when they get older. Rabbits that have a correct balance of hay, fruits and vegetables, however, should have no problem with overgrown teeth.",

Whether your rabbit’s enclosure is indoor or outdoors, it needs to be cleaned at least once a day to remove their daily droppings. Their bedding should be changed every week or twice a week, depending on how many rabbits you have in one hutch/enclosure.  There are many different kinds of bedding available on the market, some of them better in quality than others. Make sure to take the time to read labels and find out which one is best for your particular enclosure and rabbit situation. English Lops love to play! Make sure to take your rabbit out of their enclosure everyday (even if its just for a few hours) so they can stretch out their muscular legs and hop around. They also enjoy being petted on the head and back, much like a cat, and won’t hesitate to hop over to their caregiver to receive the occasional head pat.",

A rabbit’s teeth, for instance, never stops growing and is only filed down by a diet rich in hay. Should your rabbit not be eating enough hay, their teeth may overgrow and poke into their faces and jaws. To prevent this, make sure your rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay (such as timothy) and periodically check their mouths for any overgrown teeth. Also be wary of ear mites that can grow inside your Lionhead rabbit’s ears. Symptoms include scratching more than usual in one or both ears and they make even have some fur loss on the ears. If you suspect your rabbit has ear mites, take them to your local veterinarian to get treated. Most domesticated rabbits also carry the E. cuniculi parasite, which is an abbreviation for Encephalitozoon cuniculi. While this parasite is present, a large percentage of domestic rabbits will not be hurt by it, however if the rabbit is overly stressed, the parasite may become active. Symptoms include a head tilt, paralysis, excessive urination and decreased vision. Consult your local veterinarian to learn more about this parasite or if you suspect your rabbit is suffering from it. Female Lionhead rabbits who have been spayed have a decreased risk of developing uterine cancer, so it’s a good idea to get your doe spayed as young as four months of age. Bucks can be neutered as young as three and a half months old.",

Their small sizes make them wonderful apartment dwellers and a great pet for homes so long as they have plenty of time out of their enclosures so they can play and bond with their human family. Once comfortable, this rabbit will kick back, relax in its den and groom itself with its paws.

Their even temperaments and sweet nature also makes them perfect pets for couples, singles, seniors or retirees who would like some furry companionship. Rabbits are a little harder to litter train than rabbits and dogs, but it is possible. They tend to “go” in one particular corner of their enclosures so they associate whatever material is used in that corner as the ideal place to do the deed. Consequently, should you place a few of these litter boxes with the same material in different corners of your home, your rabbit may put two and two together.

        "ailments": "Your betta fish can theoretically develop any of the many diseases that affect freshwater aquarium fish but there are a few diseases you are more likely to see. Many of the diseases to which bettas are prone are bacterial in nature – bacterial infections are most likely to set in when your tank is poorly maintained. Here is an overview of the most common betta fish diseases: Fin rot, Tail rot, Ich, Popeye, Velvet, Dropsy, Mouth fungus. Fin rot and tail rot are typically caused by some kind of fungus or bacteria and they can eat away at your betta’s tail and fins. Keeping your tank clean is the best way to prevent rot but, if your betta does develop it, antibiotic medications like sulfadimidine and erythromycin are usually effective. Ich is a parasitic disease that causes small white spots to develop on the body and fins of infected fish. This disease is highly contagious but it is also very treatable if caught early. Treat ich with a salt bath or try medications like malachite green. Popeye is a disease that causes swelling in one or both of the eyes and it may be caused by either a tumor or a viral infection. This disease is easily treated with antibiotics like tetracycline. Velvet is another parasitic disease that causes the development of rust-colored mist all over the fish’s body – your betta may also clamp his fins against his body. This disease is treatable with a salt bath or medications like BettaZing. Dropsy is actually a symptom of disease that causes the fish’s body to swell. The swelling is due to the accumulation of fluid caused by kidney failure and it is often fatal. Mouth fungus, on the other hand, is usually treatable when caught early enough. It is caused by a bacterial infection and can be treated with amoxicillin.",

It is not uncommon to see Betta Splendens housed in tiny jars full of dirty water. However, Betta Splendens thrive when raised in a moderately sized aquarium with lots of plant cover and subdued lighting. Betta Splendens are Labyrinth Fish and are able to breathe by inhaling surface air. For this reason, it is important to ensure that the Betta Splenden aquarium has sufficient open surface areas and also that the water in the aquarium is not disturbed by powerful filters. Although Bettas can be kept with other types of tropical freshwater fish, they should not be kept with tank mates with large, flowing fins like guppies or angel fish, as the Bettas will often start nipping at them.",

While the most common type of Betta Splenden found in pet stores is the veil tail Betta, modern Betta Splendens have been selectively bred to create a dazzling array of fin shapes and color variants. Bettas are a generally peaceful species of fish, but are extremely aggressive towards their own kind. Often referred to as Siamese fighting fish, Betta males cannot be kept together in the same aquarium as they will fight each other, sometimes to the death. When confronted with their own reflections, male Bettas will flare out his gills, spread his fins and attempt to attack this reflection. Males and females should also be kept separately, except when breeding, as the males will harass and attack the females as part of the courtship ritual. However, it is possible to keep one male with several females in a moderately sized aquarium where the females can escape the male’s aggression by swimming out of reach. Bettas are native to the swamp lands and paddy fields of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.",

The fins are a large contributor to why these fish are so attractive. They have majestic double anal and caudal fins that flow behind them as they swim. Be careful, as they can be very tempting for fin-nipping fish. When viewed from above, the tail appears as a triangle, which is where the term ‘Fantail’ comes from. If the tail is particularly long, they are referred to as “ribbontails” (but still classed as Fantails). Occasionally, this variety has telescope eyes. These will not develop until the fish is six months old, so it can be hard to tell if juveniles will have them or not.n The most common colors are oranges, reds, or yellows.

Despite being a well-known condition, it is generally incurable and often fatal to the fish. However this disease is also generally preventable. The disease cycle begins when microsporidian parasite spores enter the fish after it consumes infected material, such as the bodies of a dead fish, or live food such as tubifex, which may serve as intermediate hosts. The disease is most likely passed by newly acquired fish that have not been quarantined. Symptoms include restlessness, loss of coloration, lumps on the body as cysts develop, difficulty swimming, curved spines as the disease progresses, and secondary infections, such as fin rot and bloating. A so-called 'false neon disease', which is bacterial, shows very similar symptoms. It is impossible for the home aquarist to determine for certain the difference between NTD and false NTD on the basis of visible symptoms alone, without laboratory backup. This disease has also been confused with columnaris (mouth rot, mouth fungus, 'flex'). Generally the best 'treatment' is the immediate removal of diseased fish to preserve the remaining fish, although some occasional successful treatments have been performed that include fish baths and a 'medication cocktail'. The use of a diatom filter, which can reduce the number of free parasites in the water, may help. As with Pleistophora neon tetra disease, prevention is most important and this disease is rare when good preventive measures are performed.",

You should keep the pH level below 7.0 and above 6.0 and maintain soft water (<10 dGH). As for lighting they will want subdued lighting; a low watt fluorescent light can be used. You should provide 2 watts per gallon. Tetras produce a very small bio load so their filtering needs are very small; a regular sponge filter will do. Finally in terms of water changes, you should aim to perform a 25% water change each week. Make sure not to exceed this recommendation as too much water change can be deadly for Neons.",

Infection is caused by them eating nematode’s eggs or larvae, which can be found on unclean food and in dirty tanks. Once the larvae are eaten, there is a three month infection period as the worm goes through its life cycle. The worm will steal nutrition from its host, making the fish appear weak over time. Infected fish may display inflammation, cysts or bleeding. If you notice these symptoms in your fish, it’s important to separate them from the tank as quickly as possible. The parasite can be treated with a dewormer administered by a veterinarian that specializes in aquarium fish. Hexamita is another parasite that affects Cichlids. It is caused by the ingestion of a protozoan that infects the fish’s intestines and gallbladder. The symptoms of a Hexamita infection include: 1. weight loss 2. sluggishness 3. paleness 4. discoloration; It can be treated with medicine administered by a fish veterinarian.  To prevent parasitic infections make sure that you are clean your tank at least once a fortnight, or more in particularly messy or smaller tanks. Make sure that you are carefully inspecting the food you give to your fish. Never give them wild-caught prey. Any new fish that you plan to place in your community tank should be quarantined for 2 to 4 weeks to make sure they are healthy.",

They do not require large open swimming spaces and do best in aquariums planted heavily with reedy plants. They should be housed in large aquariums with sufficient height to accommodate their tall body shapes. Angelfish are diurnal and prefer dimly lit aquariums with ample hiding spaces. Although they are generally considered a peaceful species of fish, they can sometimes be territorial. It is advisable to raise them in a group of 6 or more as this often dulls their aggression and bullying.

They are found in the river basin and its tributaries in Peru, Colombia, and Guiana. They are one of the most popular freshwater Cichlid choices due to their fancy appearance, ease of care, and lack of aggression compared to other Cichlid species. In well-kept tanks, these fish can live up to 10 years. They reach maturity at around 10 months of age. Since they are so popular, you can find them at most aquarium suppliers and pet shops.",
        "grooming": "This Cichlid tank should be kept between 75 and 82°F. The pH should be anywhere from 6.8 to 7. Cichlids like to dig, so any substrate you place in the tank should be soft and fine. This will prevent cuts and scrapes to their scales and fins. Fine sand/mud will make the best substrate for them. Freshwater Angelfish are used to very small amounts of flow, so there is no need to generate a powerful current – you should use low flow aeration or an under-gravel filter. The tank will need exposure to 8 to 12 hours of light per day. Any aquarium light that can mimic the sun will do just fine. To create a miniature swamp that mirrors your Angel’s tropical swampland, you can use plants that are native to the Amazon River. Amazon Sword plants have wide, broad leaves that make a safe and comfortable place for your fish to a hideout. Brazilian Waterweed, more commonly known as Anacharis, is another good choice for an Angel tank. Outside of native South American plants, you can include Java Fern and Java Moss.

Depending on the stage you recognize them, the disease will be more or less difficult to treat. The Ich disease is one of the most common diseases in the aquarium hobby. It is a parasite which causes white spots on the body, gills and fins. If not cured, this can cause severe infections and respiratory damage to the fish. There are many treatments, from raising water temperatures to using medication. Fin Rot is another common disease given by bacterial infection of the tails or fin. Antibiotics are usually the best options such as chloromycetin or tetracycline. You can add these while feeding your fish. The best thing you can do is try to proactively prevent diseases by maintaining good water quality and a balanced healthy diet. Reducing the level of stress is essential for your fish and you can do this by giving them the best possible environment. Stressed fish are more likely to get sick.

Common signs include a loss of appetite, inactivity, spots, wounds and color changes. Cleaning the tank and switching up their diet are a couple of easy ways to reduce the intensity of disease. If the problems persist, there are treatments that you can purchase from stores.",
        "care": "In the wild mollies inhibit brackish water environments like estuaries and prefer hard, slightly base water conditions in the aquarium. Mollies also benefit when a little sea salt is added to their aquariums. A relatively adaptable fish, mollies are also able to survive in marine aquariums and freshwater aquariums. Mollies are very active swimmers and their aquariums should be heavily planted with abundant open swimming spaces. Mollies are a relatively peaceful species of fish and are suitable additions to most community tanks. However, they are known to start harassing fish like goldfish or angel fish that have long flowing finnage. For this reason, mollies should either be kept with other livebearers of comparable size like swordtails, or larger more assertive fish that will be able to scare them away if they get too rambunctious.",
        "description": "The Molly is one of the most popular species of livebearers in aquarium culture. They are a relatively hardy and adaptable species and are excellent for most beginner aquarists and community aquariums. The molly has a short, rectangular body and upturned mouth, somewhat similar to that of the swordtail. The male molly is much slimmer in shape than the female and has a modified anal fin which is used in mating.",
        "descriptionImage": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/molly-fish.jpg",
        "exterior": "There are lots of molly fish varieties – most are very similar to the common molly (Poecilia sphenops). The main differences are colors and patterns, but sizes and shapes can differ too. The common molly has a flattened body. It’s tall in the middle and narrows towards a point at the mouth. At the other end is the caudal fin which is a large fan that can be transparent or colorful. The dorsal fin can be raised as a fan, resembling the caudal fin, or flatter against the body. Sexing these fish isn’t too hard and they are easy to mate. Females have an anal fin that spreads into a fan, whereas a male’s is pointier. Females are larger too, potentially reaching 4.5 inches. Males grow to 3 inches. Pregnant females will look even larger. Their bellies swell to be much bigger than other females.",
        "feeding": "Algae is a big part of their diet, they use their lips to scrape it from surfaces. Vegetation is important too, you can use small pieces of green vegetables from your kitchen. Lettuce, spinach, and zucchini are all good options to drop into your aquarium. You can even use them to make your own homemade fish foods. Artificial foods like flakes and pellets are an easy option. Try to supplement these with other foods to provide an wide range of nutrients. Live and frozen foods are excellent sources of protein. Bloodworms and brine shrimp will be happily accepted, but most other options work well too. Live foods are more interesting for the fish come feeding time too. Feed them small amounts twice a day. This gives their digestive system chance to process the food. Give them as much as they can finish in two minutes.",
        "fullDescription": "Molly fish, or just mollies, are freshwater fish from the genus Poecilia, in the Poeciliidae family. All the species in this genus are mollies except for the Endler’s livebearer. There are currently 40 species in this genus, so 39 of them are mollies. These fish are native to the Americas, but their habitat can vary significantly. An interesting fact about mollies is that, like guppies, they are livebearers. This means that they hold their eggs inside their body until they can give birth to live young straight into the water. They are a very popular group of fish. Most species are hardy and easy to care for, making them great for beginners. They work well in peaceful community aquariums. If kept in a healthy environment, a group of mollies will thrive and can live up to 5 years. It’s rare that you will come across a fish store that doesn’t sell mollies – they are one of the most popular freshwater fish. Common varieties can be found for $2-$4 per fish, though rarer species cost more.",
        "grooming": "Mollies are some of the most hardy and more adaptable fish out there. Just like any other fish, the big thing is a clean tank. You need to know how to clean effectively. This includes monitoring the water conditions and checking that ammonia and nitrites are at 0ppm.",

        "personality": "They are a peaceful bunch most of the time but can show signs of aggression when crowded or surrounded by aggressive tank mates. Therefore, it’s important that their tank is big enough, and that they have suitable tank mates (more on this later). Mollies are active and social so they enjoy schooling together. A shoal should be predominantly female since males are known to harass and stress females. It’s easy to spot personalities in active fish like these. Watching them for a while will quickly get you attached as you notice their individual differences.",

        "breedName": "Guppy",
        "ailments": "Guppies are very hardy fish; however their long tails can make them prone to fungal infections. Ich is common amongst these fish. This is a disease where small white dots grow on the fish’s skin and you’ll notice them rubbing their bodies against objects. To get rid of ich, you can use medication available from your local pet store. They are also prone to fin rot; the tail will look likes it’s torn. Again, this can be treated with medication, and prevented by choosing suitable tank mates who won’t nip.",
        "care": "Guppies are one of the hardiest species of freshwater aquarium fish and the care that they require is very minimal. Guppies prefer fairly hard, pH neutral water and well planted aquariums with ample swimming space. Guppies thrive in well oxygenated water, but do not like too much turbulence. So it is advisable to use a less intrusive filtration system like a sponge or box filter in the guppy aquarium. While not a schooling fish, the guppy does well when kept in large groups. They can co-exist peacefully with most other small to medium sized, non-aggressive species of aquarium fish. Care should be taken not to raise guppies in aquariums with larger cichlids or catfish, as the guppies will often be swallowed whole by these larger tank mates. When given adequate care, a guppy will often live up to 3 years.",
        "description": "One of the most commonly available species of freshwater aquarium fish, the guppy is a long favorite amongst aquarium enthusiasts worldwide. Their undemanding and hardy nature makes them perfect for the novice aquarist, and their peaceful temperament make them an excellent addition to most community aquariums.",
        "descriptionImage": "https://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/guppy-1-300x208.jpg",
        "exterior": "In the wild, females are typically grey and males have colorful stripes, spots or splashes in a wide range of colors. There are so many aquarium varieties due to breeders creating new strains with brighter colors and more patterns on their bodies and tails; even today, there are still new varieties being introduced. These fish are sexually dimorphic, which means you can tell the males from the females just by looking at them. These fish come in almost every color imaginable, which is where they get the nickname ‘Rainbow Fish’ from. They are normally a paler color on the top and upper half of the body, and the rear part is usually a brighter, more vivid color. Some varieties can also look metallic. They have iridophores which are cells that don’t have color, and reflect light which creates an iridescent effect.",
        "feeding": "Guppies are omnivores, which means they eat both plant and animal matter. They are not fussy eaters and will eat whatever you give them, including mosquito larvae. Their main diet should be good quality fish flakes. Ensure you choose a product which is high in protein, and not filler foods.  To ensure this, check the order of ingredients (ingredients are listed by weight). High quality foods will have proteins listed first (for example, other fish, shrimp, and meaty products). Avoid fish flakes which have fillers such as wheat and soy listed as the first few ingredients. To supplement the fish flakes you can feed your fish either live or frozen foods such as shrimp and bloodworms. You can also give them vegetables such as peas, lettuce and cucumber. Fish stores sell triangular cone feeders which you can use to feed them live and frozen foods such as bloodworms. The fish can then swim up to the cone, which is a little like plastic mesh, and pull food out of one of the many holes. You should feed your fish once or twice a day, and only an amount of food which they can eat within two minutes. Don’t feed your fish only one type of food because this will lead to nutrient deficiencies. You should alternate between flake food, live/frozen food and vegetables. You could feed them flakes in the morning and an alternative in the evening. If you over feed your fish, this can lead to problems with their health and affect the water quality in your tank. By following the rule above, there shouldn’t be any leftover food in the tank, but if there is – you can just remove it using a net so it doesn’t settle on the floor and start rotting. If you have fry in the tank, you’ll also need to think about how to feed them. They will need to be fed smaller amounts, more frequently. You can feed them either the same foods as the adults, but crushed up, or you can buy specific fry food. Feed them around four to five times per day.",
        "fullDescription": "Guppies are freshwater tropical fish native to South America, and are from the Poeciliidae family. Poecilia wingei(also known as an Endler Guppy) is also part of the Poeciliidae family and is closely related to the common Guppy (Poecilia reticulata). It is thePoecilia reticulatathat we’ll be discussing in this article. There are almost 300 varieties of Guppies. They come in all different types of colors, sizes and tail shapes. Their name derives from Robert John Lechmere Guppy, who found them in Trinidad back in 1866. It was taken back to British Museum and given the name Girardinus guppii, by an Ichthyologist. Since then, the fish has undergone a few name changes, including Lebistes reticulatusand is now known as Poecilia reticulata. They are also known by a few other common names such as The Millions Fish (because of their amazing breeding rate) and The Rainbow Fish (because of the wide variety of colors they come in). As well as the beautiful color and active nature they bring to the tank, they have also been used in freshwaters in Asia to control the mosquito population; however in some cases their release had a negative impact on the native fish populations.",
